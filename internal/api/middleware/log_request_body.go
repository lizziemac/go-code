// LogRequestBody is a middleware that logs the HTTP request body along with the method and path.
// It reads the request body, logs its contents using the application's logger, and then resets
// the body so that downstream handlers can still access it.
//
// TODO: Move to internal/middleware (common) when truly specific API middleware is added. This is for demonstration.
// TODO: Enforce a size limit for production.
// TODO: Use a standard like OpenTelemetry for structured logging in production.
